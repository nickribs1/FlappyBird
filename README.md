# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird AI project using NEAT neural network

Using the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) evolutionary algorithm, I created an artificial neural network that could perfectly play the game Flappy Bird. 

The original documentation for the NEAT algorithm can be found [here](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf).


Additionally, I made a Flappy Bird game that can be played by humans, seen in the flappy_game_playable.py file. Enjoy!
